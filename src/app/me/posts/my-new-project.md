I recently started a new presonal project: a habits and reminders website. I usually start a few projects, but I rarely finish them, and this was one of them. You can test it by accessing [natan.sh](https://natan.sh).

A few years ago I made an app with basically the same purpose for a college project, and now I've followed the idea and turned it into a website.

## Stack

### Next.js

I chose next.js for the frontend because of my knowledge from previous projects, and also because I really enjoy using it, especially with Tailwind and TypeScript.

### Supabase

Supabase is a very good open source project, and with its free plan, it had everything I needed.

## Screens

Basically, I wanted a very minimalist design, so I took advantage of the .sh domain to make subtle references to Linux, I don't know, it just seemed like a great idea at the time.

### Home page

It's like a dashboard. It gathers information about your habits, reminders, and allows you to write daily notes.

### Profile page

I had created this design in Figma for another project, but I ended up using it here.

## Things to do

I want to create a button to change the theme, I like websites that offer various theme options. Additionally, I want to add the option to change the language, I'd like it to have at least English and Portuguese.
