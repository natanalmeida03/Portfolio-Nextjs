This is the real first post and i want to share why I'm starting this blog. Probably no one will read my posts, but I want to save them for my future self. The reason I started this is to:

- Learn to write better
- Share knowledge with others
- Create a personal archive of thoughts and projects

## Learn to Write Better?

It's not hard to see that writing long texts isn't my strong point. Writing posts as often as I plan won't be an easy task, and not only that, but in another language and without any help. I believe that after a while, I hope to notice a difference in my english and my writing.

## Share knowledge with others?

Maybe not for the others, share with future me. Share how to solve some programming puzzles, interest things that i've learned. Everything that I want.

> Knowledge grows when it is shared.

## Create a personal archive of thoughts and projects?

I don't want it to be just a blog to learn about something, I want to document my thoughts and especially my projects, I hope this encourages me.

Maybe I'll give up writing tomorrow --I hope not-- but know that putting this plan on paper was already a very important step.
